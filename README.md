## About the app:
  - *SAFE FOR SCIC*
  - This is my own idea to project for programming hero learners. 
  - User can check if he is safe or not for SCIC (by submitting assignment marks) with feedback.
  - Language: React 18 & tailwind v3. No extra package have used.
  - Small project.
  - Developed by **Rahat Faruk** (me).

## Case study:
In this project, i have learned the importance of soling a problem step by step. I have stuck in the result section where I couldn't find proper way to stop checking criterias when the a criteria is failed. Then I solved the problem using function and *return* keyword; when any criteria fails, then *return* (to stop checking others). I have also got stuck when I need to turn assignment-amount into an array of that length. I solved this by using `Array(amount).fill(null)` (found on google).

## Requirement:
SCIC condition:
  1. Must submit all assignment
  2. User must secure at least 50% marks in first 9 projects, 70% in last 3 projects
  3. total avg must be at least 50 mark
